# 301-tester

This program will take all the URLs you provide it and ping them to see if their 301 redirects are set up correctly.

Clone the repo to your local enviroment and access it in your browser.
First input the domain that you wish to test, all 301s that are tested will be relative to this URL.
In the large textbox below that input the old URL for example /contact-us followed by a space and the new URL (where it should redirect to) eg /get-in-touch
Each URL needs to be put onto a new line.

The Delimiter field is the value that seperates the old URLs from the new URLs, by default this is a space

The dummy-data.txt file contains examples of old to new URLs.
